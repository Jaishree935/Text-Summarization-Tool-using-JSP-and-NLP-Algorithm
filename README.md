This project aims to build a tool that can summarize long pieces of text using Java Server Pages (JSP). The tool helps create short and meaningful summaries of large texts by following the concept of extractive summarization. This means the tool selects important sentences directly from the original text, instead of rewriting or rephrasing them. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to pick out the most important parts of the text while leaving out unnecessary information. The tool leverages the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm, a popular technique in NLP. This algorithm works by analyzing how often words appear in the text (term frequency) and how important they are based on their occurrence across multiple documents (inverse document frequency). Sentences that contain the most significant terms are chosen to be part of the summary. Powered by popular NLP libraries like Apache OpenNLP or Stanford NLP, the system processes the text by first breaking it down into smaller parts (called tokenizing) and then analyzing these parts to identify key sentences. Unnecessary or repetitive content is removed based on the TF-IDF scores. This tool will have a user-friendly web interface built using JSP. Users can upload documents or paste text, and the tool will process the text and generate a shorter version using extractive summarization techniques. The summary is then displayed for the user to read. This kind of tool can be very useful in areas like journalism, education, and research, where people need to quickly understand large amounts of information. By using JSP, the tool can be easily used on websites, and it has the potential to be part of bigger systems for companies or organizations.
